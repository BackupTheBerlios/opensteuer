This is the Opensteuer library to calculate the German income tax.

If you got this copy directly from CVS, then you need to run this
command first:
  make -f Makefile.dist

After that, you can build it as any usual package:
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Useful arguments to ./configure can be e.g.
  ./configure --prefix=/my/preferred/prefix --enable-debug
