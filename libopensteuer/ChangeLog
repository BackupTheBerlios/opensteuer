	* configure.ac: Add code and optional argument for locating
	libgnat.a.

	* src/ada/Makefile.am: Remove libtool. Add build rules for shared
	library build "by hand". Not ideal, but there seems to be no other
	choice for Ada shared libraries.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, src/ada/Makefile.am: Source code
	unchanged, but the build system was switched over to
	autoconf/automake/libtool. This way, every system-dependent
	variable is set when calling ./configure.

2003-12-10  Christian Stimming  <stimming@tuhh.de>

	* src/ada/libopensteuer.h: Added C header file for exported
	functions.

	* src/ada/Makefile: Added variable for gnatgcc (on my system this
	is simply gcc). Added more required commands to build a shared
	library that is actually usable from C, as described in the gnat
	info manual.

	* src/ada/libopensteuer.ads, src/ada/libopensteuer.adb: Added
	functions that can be used as data setter/getter from C. Added
	pragma Export for exporting these functions to C.

	* Makefile: Added variable for ADALIB_DIR.
