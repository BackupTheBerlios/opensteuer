	* src/swig/libopensteuer.i: Added module definition file for SWIG,
	so that theoretically wrappers for many scripting languages are
	now available. However, compiling and installing the correct
	object files seems to be not so trivial. So far only "make test"
	with one python module is implemented. The include path for python
	is auto-detected by configure. TODO: If there is no python, then
	the python code shouldn't be compiled, but currently this would
	probably give an error.

	* configure.ac: Add code and optional argument for locating
	libgnat.a.

	* src/ada/Makefile.am: Remove libtool. Add build rules for shared
	library build "by hand". Not ideal, but there seems to be no other
	choice for Ada shared libraries.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, src/ada/Makefile.am: Source code
	unchanged, but the build system was switched over to
	autoconf/automake/libtool. This way, every system-dependent
	variable is set when calling ./configure.

	* src/ada/libopensteuer.h: Added C header file for exported
	functions.

	* src/ada/Makefile: Added variable for gnatgcc (on my system this
	is simply gcc). Added more required commands to build a shared
	library that is actually usable from C, as described in the gnat
	info manual.

	* src/ada/libopensteuer.ads, src/ada/libopensteuer.adb: Added
	functions that can be used as data setter/getter from C. Added
	pragma Export for exporting these functions to C.

	* Makefile: Added variable for ADALIB_DIR.
