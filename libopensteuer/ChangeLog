	* src/ada/libopensteuer.h: Added C header file for exported
	functions.

	* src/ada/Makefile: Added variable for gnatgcc (on my system this
	is simply gcc). Added more required commands to build a shared
	library that is actually usable from C, as described in the gnat
	info manual.

	* src/ada/libopensteuer.ads, src/ada/libopensteuer.adb: Added
	functions that can be used as data setter/getter from C. Added
	pragma Export for exporting these functions to C.

	* Makefile: Added variable for ADALIB_DIR.
