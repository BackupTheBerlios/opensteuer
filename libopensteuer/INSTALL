====================================================================
 LibOpenSteuer - An open-source taxlibrary based on german tax laws
====================================================================


Requirements:
=============

Unlike most other software, this library is not written in C or C++,
but in Ada. For an overview what Ada is, have a look at the file Ada95
in Documentation (sorry, currently only in german, but the links refer
mostly to sites written in english).

To compile the source you need an Ada-compiler, for instance GNAT.
Normally it is part of a Linux-distribution.  If not, you can get it
here: <http://libre.act-europe.fr>.

You also need the following tools: make, install, rmdir, ldconfig, ln
and ranlib (the least only for static libs).


Compiling and installation:
===========================

libopensteuer uses a traditional Makefile.  $SHELL is /bin/sh.  The
default installation-dir is /usr/local.  Have a look at the main
Makefile if you want to change anything.

Note:
Always call make from the main directory!  Don't use the Makefiles in
the subdirs until you know what you're doing!

The make-options are:

make
make default
	Compile the library with optimization.

make debug
	Compile the library with debugging options.

make devel
	Compile the library with useful options for development.

make shared
	Build a shared library.

make static
	Build a static library.

make install
	Install the library, the source, and the documentation.
	Perhaps you need to be root for that.  If you didn't run
	`make shared' or `make static' before, no library will be
	created or installed, just the source and the documentation.

make uninstall
	Uninstall everything installed with make install.

make check
make test
	Run test-programs for Ada and C.  The library must have been
	installed before!  These test-programs are also a demonstration
	how to use libopensteuer.

make clean
	Clean the source-dir from all object-files, etc.

Example: `make shared install' will compile (if not already compiled),
built a shared library and install it.
