OpenSteuer - An open-source taxprogram based on german tax laws
---------------------------------------------------------------

OpenSteuer calculates the tax load based on german tax laws. It
is only useful for people concerned by these laws, which should
be german speaking people normally. For this reason, most of the
documentation may be written in german.

OpenSteuer is written in Ada95 and uses Gtk+ as a user-interface.
See the file INSTALL about information how to install it.

All known bugs are documented in the file TODO. If you find a new
bug not mentioned there, please report it to <bugs@opensteuer.de>.
Please do remind that the bug might already be fixed in a later
version. Before reporting any bugs, try out the latest available
version of OpenSteuer from <http://www.opensteuer.de>.
