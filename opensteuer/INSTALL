---------------------------------------------------------------
OpenSteuer - An open-source taxprogram based on german tax laws
---------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
-------------

To compile the program, you need the tools 'make' and 'install'
which should be available on every unixlike system. You also
need a runtime library of Gtk+, version 1.x. Gtk-2.x is not yet
supported by OpenSteuer. This will change in a further version.

Unlike most other software for unixlike systems, this program
is not written in C or C++, but in Ada95. For an overview what
Ada is, have a look at the file Ada95 in this directory (sorry,
currently only in german, but the links refer mostly to sites
written in english).

To compile the Ada-sources you need:

 * an Ada-compiler, GNAT for instance,

 * GtkAda-1.x, a binding for Gtk-1.x.

On Linux-systems both are normally part of the distribution. If
not, you may get the sources from <http://libre.act-europe.fr>.


To compile and install the program do:
--------------------------------------

 * copy the file opensteuer-x.y.tar.gz to a directory of your
   wish, for instance ~/src.

 * Enter this directory and unpack the tar.gz-file like this:
   'tar -zxvf opensteuer-x.y.tar.gz'. Replace x.y by the actual
   version.

 * Enter the new directory opensteuer-x.y

 * Edit the Makefile to set the paths for your installation. By
   default the program will be installed to /usr/local/bin. The
   man-page will go to /usr/local/man/man1. Make sure, the paths
   are set in the environment.

 * Run 'make' to compile the program.

 * Run 'make install' to install it. For the default installation,
   you have to be root to do that. If the required paths do not
   exist, you will get a message. Type 'make dirs install' in this
   case, if you want the paths to be automatically created.
